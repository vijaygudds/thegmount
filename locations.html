                                                        <p>Haldighati is a mountain pass in the Aravalli Range of Rajasthan in western India which connects Rajsamand and Pali districts. The pass is located at a distance of 40 kilometres from Udaipur. The name 'Haldighati' is believed to have originated from the turmeric-coloured yellow soil of the area.</p>
                                                        <p>Maharana Pratap's horse Chetak played a pivotal role in the Battle of Haldighati. Chetak was fatally wounded in this battle and died on 21 June 1576. Maharana Pratap erected a small monument for his horse at the place where Chetak fell. The cenotaph still exists at Haldighati.</p>
